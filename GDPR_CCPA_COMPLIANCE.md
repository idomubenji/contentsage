# GDPR and CCPA Compliance Implementation

This document outlines our implementation of GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) compliance measures within our Supabase database architecture.

## Overview

Our compliance strategy addresses these key requirements:

1. **Data Protection & Privacy by Design**: Security measures built into our database architecture
2. **Transparency**: Clear visibility into what data is stored and how it's processed
3. **User Control**: Mechanisms for users to exercise their rights (access, delete, export)
4. **Audit & Accountability**: Comprehensive logging of all data operations
5. **Data Minimization**: Only collecting necessary data for specified purposes
6. **Cookie Consent**: Obtaining explicit consent for non-essential cookies

## Implementation Components

### 1. Row-Level Security (RLS)

RLS policies ensure users can only access their own data:

- Each table containing personal data has appropriate RLS policies
- Users can only view, update, or delete their own records
- Special roles (admin, support) have carefully scoped access

**Files**: `migrations/01_row_level_security.sql`

### 2. User Consent Management

A robust consent tracking system:

- Stores explicit user consent for different data processing activities
- Maintains an audit trail of consent changes
- Prevents data processing without appropriate consent
- Records consent to specific versions of privacy policies
- Manages cookie consent preferences

**Files**: 
- `migrations/02_user_consent.sql`
- `migrations/20240226_cookie_consent.sql`

### 3. Data Retention & Deletion

Automated mechanisms for data lifecycle management:

- Configurable retention periods for different data types
- Automated anonymization of inactive user data
- Complete data deletion capabilities
- Data deletion logging for compliance proof

**Files**: 
- `migrations/03_data_retention.sql`
- `migrations/20240225_data_rights_tables.sql`

### 4. Audit Logging

Comprehensive logging of all data operations:

- Tracks who accessed what data and when
- Records all modifications to personal data
- Special handling for sensitive data operations
- Maintains logs for required compliance periods

**Files**: 
- `migrations/04_audit_logging.sql`
- `migrations/20240225_data_rights_tables.sql`

### 5. Data Encryption

Multi-layered encryption strategy:

- Server-side column-level encryption for sensitive fields
- Client-side encryption for highly sensitive data
- Encryption key rotation capabilities
- Secure key management procedures

**Files**: 
- `migrations/05_column_encryption.sql`
- `client-encryption/encryption-utils.js`

### 6. Cookie Consent Management

Compliance with GDPR and CCPA cookie requirements:

- Unintrusive cookie banner for consent collection
- Option to accept all or only necessary cookies
- Persistent storage of cookie preferences
- Detailed cookie preferences management interface
- Automatic removal of non-essential cookies when rejected

**Files**:
- `src/components/privacy/CookieConsent.tsx`
- `src/app/privacy-settings/cookie-preferences/page.tsx`

## User Rights Implementation

### Right to Access

Users can request all their personal data:

- API endpoints for data export
- Comprehensive data collection across all tables
- Machine-readable format (JSON)
- Includes processing purposes and retention periods

**Files**:
- `src/app/api/user/data/route.ts`
- `src/app/privacy-settings/data-rights/page.tsx`

### Right to Be Forgotten

Two-tiered approach to data deletion:

1. **Anonymization**: Replace personal data with anonymous values while preserving analytics data
2. **Complete Deletion**: Fully remove all user data from the system

**Files**:
- `src/app/api/user/delete/route.ts`
- `src/app/privacy-settings/data-rights/page.tsx`

### Right to Data Portability

Export functionality that provides:

- Complete user data in a structured format
- Common, machine-readable format (JSON)
- Direct download capability

**Files**:
- `src/app/api/user/export/route.ts`
- `src/app/privacy-settings/data-rights/page.tsx`

### Right to Rectification

Users can update their personal information through:

- Profile update forms
- Data correction requests
- History tracking of changes

### Right to Object to Processing

Implementation of cookie preferences allows users to:

- Opt out of non-essential cookies
- Manage detailed cookie preferences
- Update consent preferences at any time

**Files**:
- `src/components/privacy/CookieConsent.tsx`
- `src/app/privacy-settings/cookie-preferences/page.tsx`

## Technical Implementation Guide

### Database Schema Changes

We've added several new tables to support compliance:

- `user_consent`: Tracks user consent for different purposes
- `data_deletion_log`: Records deletion operations
- `user_deletion_requests`: Tracks and manages user deletion requests 
- `data_access_logs`: Records data access and export operations
- `audit_logs`: Comprehensive operation logging
- `encryption_keys`: Securely stores encryption keys

### Applied Security Measures

1. **Field-level encryption** for sensitive data (SSN, financial information)
2. **Data masking** in logs and non-essential contexts
3. **Access controls** through RLS policies
4. **Audit trails** for all data operations

### Client-Side Security

For especially sensitive data, we implement:

1. **Client-side encryption** before sending to Supabase
2. **Key management** in secure client storage
3. **Encrypted data transmission** via HTTPS

## Cookie Consent Implementation

### Cookie Banner

We've implemented a GDPR/CCPA compliant cookie consent banner that:

- Appears when a user logs in and hasn't yet provided consent
- Allows users to choose between "Accept All" and "Necessary Only" cookies
- Is unintrusive (small banner at the bottom of the screen)
- Stores consent preferences in both localStorage and the database
- Automatically removes non-essential cookies if the user chooses "Necessary Only"

### Cookie Categories

We categorize cookies into the following groups:

1. **Strictly Necessary**: Essential for the website to function properly
2. **Functional**: Enhance functionality and personalization
3. **Analytics**: Help us understand how visitors interact with the website
4. **Marketing**: Used for targeted advertising and marketing purposes

### Cookie Management

The cookie preferences page allows users to:

- View detailed information about each cookie category
- See the specific cookies used, their purposes, and durations
- Toggle consent for each non-essential cookie category
- Save preferences with a complete audit trail in the database

### Compliance Features

Our cookie consent implementation ensures:

- No non-essential cookies are set before consent is given
- Users can easily change their preferences at any time
- Consent is recorded with a timestamp and version for compliance
- Rejected cookies are automatically removed from the browser

## Maintenance Procedures

### Regular Audits

- Quarterly review of access logs
- Verification of deletion processes
- Testing of data export functionality

### Key Rotation

- Regular rotation of encryption keys
- Secure key management procedures
- Validation of encrypted data after rotation

### Policy Updates

Process for updating privacy policies:

1. Draft policy changes
2. Update consent forms
3. Notify users
4. Track consents to new policy version

### Deletion Request Handling

Process for handling deletion requests:

1. User submits deletion request via data rights interface
2. Request is recorded in the `user_deletion_requests` table
3. Admin reviews and processes the request 
4. User is notified when deletion is complete
5. Audit logs maintained for compliance requirements

## API Endpoints for Data Subject Rights

We've implemented the following API endpoints to support user data rights:

1. **GET /api/user/data** - Allows users to access all their personal data
2. **GET /api/user/export** - Enables users to download their data in a portable format
3. **POST /api/user/delete** - Processes requests for account/data deletion

All endpoints include:
- Authentication and authorization checks
- Comprehensive error handling
- Audit logging for compliance purposes
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

## User Interface for Data Rights

We've created a dedicated user interface for data rights management:

- **Data Rights Page**: `/privacy-settings/data-rights`
- Features tabbed interface for different rights (access, export, delete)
- Clear explanations of each right and its implications
- Secure request submission with appropriate confirmations
- Status tracking for deletion requests

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Create an admin interface for handling deletion requests
2. Implement more detailed user consent options
3. Establish regular compliance testing procedures
4. Set up monitoring for unusual data access patterns
5. Enhance data export with additional format options (CSV)
6. Implement automatic cookie scanning to maintain an up-to-date cookie inventory
